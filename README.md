# EUR/USD Depth of Market Visualization Tool

## Project Description
The EUR/USD Depth of Market Visualization Tool is a application designed to provide traders and quantitative analysts with comprehensive insights into historical DOM data for the EUR/USD currency pair. This tool focuses on identifying significant volume patterns that could indicate potential trend reversals, empowering users with actionable intelligence for informed trading decisions.

## Key Features
Historical DOM Analysis: Users can delve into past DOM data, exploring detailed visual representations of market depth over selected periods.
Pattern Discovery: The tool is optimized to detect and highlight substantial volume patterns, assisting in the recognition of market sentiment shifts.
Trend Reversal Insights: By analyzing historical data, the application provides indicators that may forecast trend reversals, aiding users in anticipating market movements.
User-Friendly Interface: Built on Python and leveraging the Tkinter library, the tool offers an intuitive graphical user interface that simplifies complex data analysis.

## How It Works
The application processes historical pickle files containing DOM data, compiles them into a cohesive dataset, and presents this information through a dynamic visualization interface. Users can observe how large trade volumes have historically affected price action and apply this knowledge to predict future market behavior.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries (pickle, os, tkinter, numpy).
Place your historical DOM data pickle files in the designated data directory. As example how the data should be represented, in repository stored pickle file with historical data.
Run the main script “visualize_deep_of_the_market_tkinter_draw_without_graphic_library.py” to launch the visualization interface.
